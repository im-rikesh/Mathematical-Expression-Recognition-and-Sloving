# Mathematical-Expression-Recognition-and-Sloving
This project asks for a picture of a mathematical expression and provides a step-wise solution.

tech_miner.py is the main Python code.
I copied a part of this code from another code. I would be more than happy to give credit. Since it was a long time ago, I don't remember where I copied from. Thank you!

gropu.gif is the image for the root window.
sampleXX.jpg are the sample images that you can use to test this code.

You can take a picture of any computer-printed expression and solve it using this application.

All the procedures are updated on my YouTube channel. Click on the link below:
